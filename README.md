# CS370-PirateAgent
## Project Summary
  The following project Reinforcement Deep Learning. We are provided with necessary to run the specific tresure huntin games - such as the moves, point system, etc. 
  We are required to create the Q-Algoritnm for storing and saving the different experiences the agent goes through in order to acheive its goal of finding the treaure. 
  
## Personal Perspective
  This was a challenging, but rewarding project and class! Prior to taking this course, I believed machine learning was a topic that required a PHD to understand.
  However after alot of reading and hardwork, I was able to grasp the important concepts about machine learning. It is important to approach this topic of machine learning with problem solving mindset. Although is not too difficult to start training a model, there are alot of specific variables that can alter the accuracy, time complexity, and effectiveness of your model. I hope to take this new found knowledge and incorporate it into my home projects. It was important me to undestand that machine learning models are a tool to solve specific problems - and are often a part of a much larger solution. With that being said, it is pretty amazing what a simple model can do with just a few epochs of training!
